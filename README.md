Hacklytics 2023 Project - Track: Energy and Sustainability

Creating a model to find the optimal location to place a solar panel using data 
from the National Solar Radiation Database. We are utilizing the humidity, wind speed, solar
zenith angle, and global horizontal irradiance data to create a score when given a certain
latitude and longtitude.
